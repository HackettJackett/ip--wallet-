# Note: hidapi requires Cython as a build-time dependency (it is not needed at runtime).
# For reproducible builds, the version of Cython must be pinned down.
# Further, the pinned Cython must be installed before hidapi is built;
# otherwise hidapi just downloads the latest Cython. To enforce order,
# Cython must be listed before hidapi. Notably this also applies to
# deterministic-build/requirements-hw.txt where items are lexicographically sorted.
# Hence, we rely on "Cython" preceding "hidapi" lexicographically... :/
